                            <h3>The computer</h3>
                            Manufacturer: HP<br>
                            CPU: Intel Core i7-5500 @ 2.4GHz (declared; actual top speed is 2.95GHz)<br>
                            RAM: 6GB<br>
                            Storage: 1TB HDD<br>
                            Former OS: Microsoft Windows 8.1<br><br>
                            <h3>The story</h3>
                            <p>It all started in 2022: after seven years and close to Windows 8.1's end of life, my laptop started to become abnormally slow as it was taking too long to start and display the desktop (up to 10 minutes or even more; I'm not exaggerating). The anti-virus programme was constantly looking for updates even when the Wi-Fi connection was disabled, so one of the CPU's cores was always at full power.</p>
                            <p>Tired of these issues, I decided to look for Linux distributions; however, not <b>any</b> distro, but lightweight ones that would keep resource usage at a minimum while displaying a clean and highly responsive desktop environment. After a few days, I discovered Lubuntu and I gave it a go in a live session: this is done by using a thumb drive as a startup CD and booting the computer from it. 'This looks GREAT', I thought. 'Feels light, no rubbish fills up the laptop's RAM, it looks responsive even in a live session... I want this in my computer!' So I compressed the Windows partition to dedicate 300GB to Lubuntu.</p>
                            <p>I have to admit it was a bit confusing at first because my Wi-Fi card, a Broadcom BCM43142, was not supported from the get-go, but it could be solved by connecting the computer to the Internet via an Ethernet cable, opening the Muon package manager and installing 'bcmwl-kernel-source'. Once this little problem was solved, everything began to go flawlessly. At this point, I'm considering saying goodbye to Windows. Forever.</p>

                            Manufacturer: AsRock<br>
                            CPU: AMD (unknown model) @ 4000MHz<br>
                            RAM: 8GB<br>

                            <h3>The story</h3>
                            <p>My father uses his desktop to watch films on the Internet and listen to music, but Windows 8 had reached its end of life some months before he had decided to ask me to help him install Windows 11. Unfortunately, its hardware requirements were (and are) excessive, so I suggested switching to a Linux distribution.</p>
                            <p>This was a risky move since my family has stuck to Windows since the day my father had bought his first computer, but the change was required so as to avoid having an outdated and vulnerable device. So I took my thumb drive, created a USB boot device, plugged it to my dad's PC and completely replaced Windows 8 with Lubuntu.</p>
                            <p>Then we installed the same platform he had on Windows together with the required add-ons and managed to make the programme work after a few attempts. A few months have passed and, apart from one or two strange situations, it's all going just fine.</p>

                            <h3>The computer</h3>
                            Manufacturer: Acer<br>
                            CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.26GHz<br>
                            RAM: 4GB<br>
                            Storage: ~250GB HDD<br>
                            Former OS: Microsoft Windows Vista first, Microsoft Windows 10 later<br><br>
                            <h3>The story</h3>
                            <p>The Acer laptop in question was bought in ~2010 and it had had Windows 10 for a few years... But it had become horribly slow and it was on the brink of failure: that OS was just too demanding for such an old device. It needed something lighter and up-to-date, so the only option was a Linux distro.</p>
                            <p>Since this was the third OS switch I was about to perform, I felt more comfortable than in previous situations. Before booting from the thumb drive, my dad and I were already used to the Acer laptop's slowness, but the change was, to put it simple, outstanding: even in a live session, it felt like it was completely new. I didn't think twice before proceeding with the installation, which - by the way - didn't require a connection via Ethernet as the laptop's Wi-Fi device is supported by the new OS.</p>
                            <p>Now it behaves flawlessly in every aspect: quick reactions to any key being pressed, no freezes while surfing the Internet, impressive performance when executing terminal commands... Except for the battery, who would guess that the computer is over 12 years old!</p>
