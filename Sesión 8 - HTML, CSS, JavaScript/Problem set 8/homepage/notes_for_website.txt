# 1 - What is Lubuntu? #
########################

> Brief description.
--> Lubuntu is an operating system which is derived from Ubuntu, a well-known Linux distribution
    which is derived from Debian, another 'distro' that is not so well known.

> Visual aspect.
--> A Linux distribution needs a "desktop environment" and a "window manager"
    if you want to see something else apart from the terminal. Lubuntu includes
    the "LXQt" desktop environment and the "Openbox" window manager. This
    combination makes Lubuntu not as resource-hungry as other modern operating
    systems while being highly responsive on not-so-powerful computers.

> What does it come with?
--> Lubuntu includes the basic equipment to start working right after its installation:
----> A web browser (Mozilla Firefox).
----> A free alternative to Microsoft Office (LibreOffice).
----> An audio and video player (VLC).
----> GUI and terminal-based text file editors (FeatherPad, Vim, Nano).
----> A PDF file viewer (qpdfview).
----> A Python 3.10 (as of October 2023) interpreter, and compilers for C, C++ and Fortran.
----> Etc.
--> If you need something else, the Muon package package manager lets you download thousands of programmes FOR FREE.

> What's its current version?
--> The Lubuntu team releases two types of versions:
----> Interim releases, once every ~6 months.
------> The current one, as of October 2023, is 23.10 "Mantic Minotaur".
----> Long-term-support (LTS) releases, published once every 2 years and supported for 36 months.
------> The current LTS version, available since April 2022, is 22.04 "Jammy Jellyfish".

# 2 - Why Lubuntu? #
####################

> Why get it?
--> Based on Ubuntu.
----> (Almost?) Any programme or package that works on Ubuntu will work on Lubuntu.
--> Light (for today's standards).
----> Other well-known operating systems come with bloatware. And it *can* be hard to get rid of it.
----> Older computers with less RAM and slower CPUs can be given a second life.
--> Easy to use right from the start.
----> When adapting to a new OS, it's good to have a simple, clean and tidy environment.
----> Within a few days, you may feel at home.
--> Highly customisable.
----> Don't like the colour of your windows' edges?
      Want to move the taskbar to the left, move the clock to the top,
      make it show the temperature of the CPU? Just make the changes you'd like!
      You might need to find the right files and understand their language,
      but you can do it!
----> However, this is like a double-edged blade: it's as easy to correctly
      perform the changes as to turn your computer into a mess!
--> Up to date.
----> Updates are available every week, and they don't slow down your computer.
--> IT'S FREE!
----> Why pay for an OS that will soon become obsolete when you can have open-source alternatives
      that can keep your computer working and up-to-date for a lot longer?

> What to watch out for?
--> Not as well known as other operating systems. 
    If you need to fix something...
----> You'll possibly need to take a look at forums like Stack Overflow, Ask Ubuntu, or Lubuntu's official forum.
      Unfortunately for some users, most of the information is in English.
----> Most of the time you'll see yourself using the terminal, and - like on any operating system - it's easy to
      mess up if you don't know what you're actually doing.
      However, don't worry: it's just a matter of documentation and a bit of practice.
--> Not designed for smartphones.
----> You may want to look at other options such as Mobian.
--> No support for 32-bit computers.
----> The Lubuntu team decided to interrupt the support for them a few years ago.
----> However, they can be resuscitated with Debian.
--> Some might find its appearance a bit too simple and miss the decorations of their former OS.
----> Lubuntu is meant to be light, and those little effects here and there might contradict its design principles.
----> If visual appearance is important to you, ...
------> You can change the desktop environment and the window manager, or ...
------> You can try a different 'distro'. There are so many...!

# 3 - Success stories #
#######################

> I'd like to share a few stories about computers whose operating system was replaced with Lubuntu.
  I swear the stories are not faked as I was the one who brought Lubuntu to the computers in the following stories.

> STORY 1 - The beginning of a love story.
--> Manufacturer: HP
--> CPU: Intel Core i7-5500 @ 2.4GHz (declared; actual top speed is 2.95 GHz)
--> RAM: 6GB
--> Storage: 1TB HDD
--> Former OS: Microsoft Windows 8.1

--> It all started in 2022: after seven years and close to 8.1's end of life, my laptop started to become abnormally
    slow as it was taking too long (up to 10 minutes!) to start and display the desktop, and even longer to shut down.
    The battery would take just two hours to discharge instead of 3.5h as before; the anti-virus programme was
    constantly working, always looking for updates even when the Wi-Fi connection was disabled, so one of my CPU's
    cores was always at full power.
--> Tired of these issues, I started to look for Linux distributions; however, not *any* distro, but lightweight
    ones that would keep resource usage at a minimum while having a clean and highly customisable desktop environment.
    After some time, I discovered Lubuntu, and decided to give it a go with live sessions: this is done by using a
    thumb drive as a startup CD and booting the computer from it. "This looks GREAT", I thought. "Feels light,
    no rubbish filling up the laptop's RAM, incredibly responsive even in a live session... I want this in my
    computer!" And decided to shrink the Windows partition to dedicate 300GB to Lubuntu.
--> It was a bit confusing at first because Broadcom's BCM43142 Wi-Fi card was not supported, but the solution was
    as easy as connecting the laptop to the Internet via an Ethernet cable, opening the Muon package manager and
    install the 'bcmwl-kernel-source' package. Nevertheless, after this small problem, no errors happened since then.
    I'm considering saying goodbye to Windows. Forever.

> STORY 2 - A new era.
--> Manufacturer: AsRock
--> CPU: AMD (GET THE MODEL) @ 4000MHz
--> RAM: 8GB
--> Storage: Two HDDs with more than 320GB each one
--> Former OS: Microsoft Windows 8

--> My father uses his desktop to watch films on the Internet and listen to music, but Windows 8 had reached its end
    of life some months before he had decided to ask me to help him install Windows 11. Unfortunately, its hardware
    requirements were (and are) excessive, so I suggested switching to a Linux distribution.
--> This was a risky move since my family has stuck to Windows since the day my father had bought his first computer,
    but the change was required so as to avoid having an outdated and vulnerable device. So I took my thumb drive,
    created a USB boot device, plugged it to my dad's PC and completely replaced Windows 8 with Lubuntu.
--> Then we installed the same platform he had on Windows together with the required add-ons and managed to make the
    programme work after a few attempts. A few months have passed and, apart from one or two strange situations,
    it's all going just fine.

> STORY 3 - Resurrection.
--> Manufacturer: Acer
--> CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.26GHz
--> RAM: 4GB
--> Storage: ~250GB HDD
--> Former OS: Microsoft Windows Vista first, Microsoft Windows 10 later

--> The Acer laptop in question was bought in ~2010 and it had had Windows 10 for a few years... But it had become
    horribly slow and it was on the brink of failure: that OS was just too demanding for such an old device. It needed
    something lighter and up-to-date, so the only option was a Linux distro.
--> Since this was the third OS switch I was about to perform, I felt more comfortable than in previous situations.
    Before booting from the thumb drive, my dad and I were already used to the Acer laptop's slowness, but the change
    was, to put it simple, outstanding: even in a live session, it felt like it was completely new. I didn't think
    twice before proceeding with the installation, which - by the way - didn't require a connection via Ethernet as
    the laptop's Wi-Fi device is supported by the new OS.
--> Now it behaves flawlessly in every aspect: quick reactions to any key being pressed, no freezes while surfing the
    Internet, impressive performance when executing terminal commands... Except for the battery, who would guess that
    the computer is 12 years old!
