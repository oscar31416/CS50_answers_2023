Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Men's World Cup 2018 - It depends on what you pay attention to. None of the top 4 national
teams in terms of predicted chance of winning the tournament participated in the actual
tournament's semi-finals, so the prediction failed there. However, it did succeed when
comparing each team's chance of winning the tournament to the rest: the French team (winner)
has a greater chance than Croatia (runner-up), and Belgium defeated England for the third
place.

Women's World Cup 2019 - The United States' team, with the third highest chance of victory,
defeated the Netherlands in the final match; meanwhile, the English team beat the Swedes
for the bronze medal. Again, the prediction both failed (the Germans were expected to win the
tournament but the Americans did) and succeeded (the American team had a 14.1% chance of
winning the competition in comparison to the Netherlands' 5.7%, and the English team's 14.7%
is noticeably greater than Sweden's 4.8%).

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After about 10000 simulations (execution time: 0.13 seconds), the results seem to stabilise.
